    "Regression is a supervised learning problem where we have a bunch of points that we'd like to have a line of best fit through.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line: $y=mx+b$ is the same as $y(x)=w_1x+w_2$, given the w's are parameters, y(x) is a function of x, and x is the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regression we are trying to minimize the parameters $w_1$ and $w_2$ using an algorithm called gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent is an iterative algorithm that will bring you a little bit closer to your minimimum parameters using the partial derivative (gradient).\n",

    "\n",
    "There are multiple forms of the Gradient Descent algorithm, including but not limited to:\n",
    "- **Stochastic GD** --> where we choose one point at which we find the gradient and descend\n",
    "- **Batch GD** --> where we calculate the gradient at all inputs of the dataset to descend\n",
    "- **Mini-Batch GD** --> like Batch GD, except we divide the inputs into chunks and descend one step at a time for each chunk\n",

    "But we're getting ahead of ourselves! Let's look at the problem at hand!"
